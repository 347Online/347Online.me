In case you missed it, I was on another episode of Tech Tales, hosted by my friend Corbin Davenport. This was my first movie club episode and I had a blast. Corbin, Zachary Wander, and myself discussed Pirates of Silicon Valley. It's hard to say it was a "good" movie, but I do highly recommend it if you have any interest in the early rivalry between Apple and Microsoft. It also has some of the best casting choices imaginable.

Check out the movie, then listen to the episode wherever you get your podcasts!
