I'm pleased to announce that I'll be joining the Techathon livestream this Saturday, September 27th.

We'll be playing games, discussing technology topics, all benefitting Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders).

MSF's life-saving mission has perhaps never been more important, so I'm incredibly honored to be participating.

Details for the event can be found at [techathon.live](https://techathon.live)

Hope to see you there!
