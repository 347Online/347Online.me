My friend Corbin has created numerous [useful tools](https://corbin.io/software/)[^link-cleaner] over the years help to make the web a better place. Unfortunately, it's not just the web that's worsening, but the browsers with which we view it too.
He's really outdone himself with [Just the Browser](https://justthebrowser.com). I myself am a Firefox user, and I've been on [my own odyssey](https://bsky.app/profile/347online.me/post/3m4rmi2kxkc2z) to get all these annoyances disabled. I've been implementing this via my [Nix config](https://github.com/347Online/347OS/), but as much as I like it for me, that's an awful lot of complexity.

I'm glad someone out there is doing the work of making these improvements accessible to as many people as possible who may not feel comfortable digging around in weird obscure settings.

Rock on, Corbin
