title: I shouldn't have to resort to half-working Firefox forks

My friend [Corbin Davenport](https://corbin.io/) has created numerous [useful tools](https://corbin.io/software/)[^link-cleaner] over the years to make the web a nicer place.
Unfortunately, it's not just the web that's worsening, but the browsers in which we view it too.

Corbin's really outdone himself with [Just the Browser](https://justthebrowser.com). I myself am a Firefox user, and I've been on [my own odyssey](https://bsky.app/profile/347online.me/post/3m4rmi2kxkc2z) to get all these annoyances disabled.
I've been implementing this via my [Nix config](https://github.com/347Online/347OS/), but while that's great for me, it's an awful lot of complexity.

I'm really glad someone out there is doing the work of making these kinds of improvements accessible to as many people as possible who may not feel comfortable digging around in weird obscure settings.

Thank you <3
