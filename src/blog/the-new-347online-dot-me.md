I've been dissatisfied with my website since oh... I dunno, a few minutes after I launched it?

I knew I could do better. A regular hey-I'm-just-a-person-who-says-stuff-sometimes website shouldn't be a <span title="that's exactly what my old site was *shudder*">React app</span>.

I've been itching to switch over to a static site generator and now that's exactly what I've done.
It's built on [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) &mdash; check out the [source code](https://github.com/347Online/347Online.me) for details.

I'm really trying to write more, and I've realized that I hated the publishing workflow for my old blog.
I'm a \[Neo\]Vim girlie and these days that's where I do all of my writing. Pasting that markdown into a web form just ain't it for me anymore.

Even as I write this I'm already quite enamored with the new workflow.
It's never felt easier to express myself.

There are still a few rough edges I'd like to polish up &mdash; if I don't have RSS soon I'll go mad &mdash; but this should be a great foundation to build on for years to come.

I hope to talk to you here again real soon. :)
