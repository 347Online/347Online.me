Recently, in a conversation with my friend and colleague Zak^[Who, by the way, also made the image seen at the top of this article which he has graciously allowed me to use here. Thanks Zak!], we came upon the subject of Toy Story^[This is an extremely common occurrence in conversations with me. My brain is a machine that turns conversational context into Toy Story references 😅]. Zak made the rather bold claim that Woody is the true villain of the first film, and we had a fun little back and forth about that before our attention was drawn back to other matters. I've seen this take go around a few times over the years, and there is certainly some truth to it! This has been rattling around in my head ever since, so I'd like to offer the slightly more complex perspective I eventually sent to Zak the following Saturday.

Woody is the protagonist, in that he is the primary character we follow throughout the story.^[Buzz is our secondary main character, the word for which is _deuteragonist_, which I find fun]. The terms protagonist and antagonist do not describe the morals of the characters, rather they describe the characters' relationship to one another within the structure of the narrative. From the start Woody is a flawed character and most certainly not a hero. He's bossy, irritable, and set in his ways. However, while villains are often also portrayed this way, these are not inherently villainous qualities.

Despite his shortcomings, we know that he does care about Andy and the other toys. Before Buzz shows up, Woody's actions are entirely in service of maintaining calm among them amidst the tension of the impending move. He's trying to ensure things go smoothly and that no toy is left behind.

Buzz' arrival disrupts the status quo to which Woody has become complacent. It's possible, if perhaps unlikely, that Woody had been entirely truthful in his initial claims not to be worried about being replaced. The events prior to the trip to Pizza Planet are a test of Woody's character which he fails! Instead of rising above his insecurities and letting Andy make his own choice, he opts to give into them by putting his thumb on the scale. In his attempt to knock Buzz behind the table, he intends only to incapacitate Buzz long enough so that he can go to Pizza Planet with Andy. Buzz falls out the window instead because this plan goes awry. Interestingly we see a glimmer of Woody's conscience take over in this scene. When Buzz falls, Woody's immediate _instinctual_ reaction is one of concern for his fellow toy, sticking his head out the window exclaiming "Buzz!". It's only after he's had a moment to process these events that, confronted by the other toys, he reverts to myopic self-interest.

Later, trapped under the milk crate in Sid's house, attempting to rally a demoralized Buzz to his aid, he is forced to finally accept responsibility for getting them into this mess in the first place, his remorse evident in his statement that "I'm the one that should be strapped to that rocket". The scene where Woody makes it into the moving truck and attempts to use R/C to rescue Buzz is a mirror image of the earlier scene at the window. His belief in "no toy left behind" reaffirmed, he refuses to make the same mistake twice. His actions here are the _exact opposite_ of those prior. Concerned only with rescuing Buzz, he wastes no time trying to explain himself^[Causing him to be thrown overboard by Rocky, ironically].

Woody is a nuanced character who, despite his principles, is not immune to his own selfish desires^[This comes up again in Toy Story 2 for that matter when the other toys show up to rescue Woody from Al], but this is exactly what makes his arc so satisfying. Facing the consequences of his actions reminds him that what's truly important is doing what's best for others, even when it's not what's best for him. Neither hero nor villain, I'd argue that his character is something far more compelling: Human.

Happy 30th Anniversary Toy Story
